  Plan and add a Stylebook canonical entity type through an interactive interview

  Agate review. Read docs/ENTITY_TYPES.md first.

# Add entity type

Use this skill when adding a **canonical entity type** (person, organization, work, or a new type beyond location) or when re-planning an existing stub type.

**Output:** `prd/<slug>/prd.md` then `prd/<slug>/issues/NN-*/issue.md` (gitignored). Hand issues to an agent for implementation.

**Read first:**

1. [`docs/ENTITY_TYPES.md`](../../docs/ENTITY_TYPES.md) — layout, Issue 00 foundation, issue order
2. [`docs/DATABASE.md`](../../docs/DATABASE.md) — shared field contracts
3. [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — package boundaries
4. **agate-ai-platform** sibling repo — copy-then-adapt per `AGENTS.md`

**Related skills:** [`write-a-prd`](../write-a-prd/SKILL.md), [`prd-to-issues`](../prd-to-issues/SKILL.md)

## Entry: detect and branch

Before interviewing, inspect the repo for **Issue 00 foundation** markers. Foundation is **present** when **all** exist:

| Marker | Path |
|--------|------|
| Entity registry + fingerprint | `packages/backfield-stylebook/src/backfield_stylebook/entity_types.py` |
| Persist domain dispatch | `apps/worker/src/worker/substrate/entities/registry.py` |
| Shared field docs | `docs/DATABASE.md` → section **Shared entity fields** |
| UI entity registry | `apps/stylebook-ui/src/lib/entityRegistry.ts` |

**If foundation is missing** → **prerequisite path** (below).

**If foundation is present** → **per-type path** (below).

**If foundation is partial** → propose an “extend shared base” issue before per-type work.

---

## Prerequisite path (Issue 00)

Use when foundation markers are missing (first time on a clone, or pre-foundation branch).

1. Confirm scope: shared substrate + Stylebook canonical contracts, orchestration registry, API/UI scaffolds — **no new entity tables**.
2. Write `prd/entity-types-foundation/prd.md` (short; reference [`docs/ENTITY_TYPES.md`](../../docs/ENTITY_TYPES.md) Issue 00).
3. Write `prd/entity-types-foundation/issues/01-shared-foundation/issue.md`.
4. Implement Issue 00 in code before running per-type planning again.

---

## Per-type path

### Interview rules

- **One question at a time.** Wait for an answer before the next question.
- **~12–14 questions** total; skip when defaults apply.
- Resolve dependencies in order; do not accept vague “it depends” without resolving each branch.

### Question script

Ask in this order (skip N/A):

1. **Slug** — Which `EntityType`? (`person`, `organization`, `work`, or new slug)
2. **Display names** — Singular/plural user-facing labels (non-technical; see `docs/FRONTEND.md`)
3. **PRD slug** — Kebab-case directory under `prd/<slug>/`
4. **Substrate entity fields** — Type-specific columns beyond [shared substrate contract](../../docs/DATABASE.md)
5. **Stylebook canonical fields** — Type-specific columns beyond shared canonical contract
6. **Fingerprint inputs** — Which normalized fields feed `compute_identity_fingerprint` for this type?
7. **Consolidated JSON key** — Confirm registry entry (default: plural of slug; `location` → `places` is legacy only)
8. **Extract output shape** — Per-entity and per-mention fields the `<Type>Extract` node must emit
9. **Mention fields** — Shared vs type-specific (`role_in_story`, `nature`, review flags)
10. **Stylebook UI** — List columns, filters (include **Minimum mentions** + project scope + URL query sync per [`FRONTEND.md`](../../docs/FRONTEND.md)), candidate clustering behavior
11. **API quirks** — Anything beyond standard list / detail / candidates / meta
12. **Agate review tab** — Enabled? List vs edit vs link-to-Stylebook actions (planned in late issue)
13. **Connection pairs** — New allowed edges in `stylebook_connections` (see `connections_utils.py`)
14. **Smoke acceptance** — Minimal demo text and success criteria for extract → DBOutput → substrate

### Pipeline profile

| Profile | Pipeline | Types |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **`extract_and_persist`** | `TextInput → <Type>Extract → DBOutput` | Default for all **new** types |
| **`location_full`** | `PlaceExtract → GeocodeAgent → DBOutput` | Location only |

- **Extract is always in the plan** for new types (no catalog-only path).
- **Enrichment/resolution nodes** are out of scope except location’s `GeocodeAgent`.
- **Agate review** is always in the plan as a **late issue** (after ingest + extract smoke).

### Consolidated JSON keys

Keys are derived from **`EntityType` slug**, not Agate tab names. Types without Agate tabs use the same rule.

| Slug | Consolidated key | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| `location` | `places` | Legacy; do not rename |
| `person` | `people` | Irregular plural |
| `organization` | `organizations` | |
| `work` | `works` | |

Registry source of truth: `backfield_stylebook.entity_types`.

### Canonical ID policy

All **new** canonical types use **UUID string** primary keys from day one (same as `stylebook_location_canonical.id`).

---

## PRD addendum

After the interview, write `prd/<slug>/prd.md` using [`write-a-prd`](../write-a-prd/SKILL.md) **plus** these sections under **Implementation Decisions**:

- **Shared vs type-specific fields** (substrate, mention, occurrence, canonical, alias, meta)
- **Consolidated key** and extract JSON schema
- **Fingerprint inputs**
- **Stylebook API surface** (routes follow `/v1/<plural>`; location URLs unchanged)
- **Stylebook UI** (columns, filters, sections)
- **Agate review tab** behavior
- **Connection pairs** to add
- **Issue ordering** (see below)

---

## Issue order template

Break the PRD into issues via [`prd-to-issues`](../prd-to-issues/SKILL.md). Standard per-type order:

| Issue | Slice | Blocked by |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **01** | Type-specific schema (Alembic migration) | Issue 00 foundation |
| **02** | `backfield_stylebook/entities/<type>/` persist + link | 01 |
| **03** | stylebook-api routers + stylebook-ui `entityConfigs/<type>.ts` + canonical list page (`<Type>s.tsx` or equivalent) with standard list filters including `min_mentions` | 02 |
| **04** | Worker `substrate/entities/<type>/` + orchestration handler registration | 01 |
| **05** | `<Type>Extract` Agate node + smoke graph | 04 |
| **06** | Agate review (agate-api + agate-ui tab) | 05 |

Each slice is a thin vertical path — demoable on its own.

---

## Layer reference (location)

Replace `<type>` with the entity slug. Prefer new paths over legacy shims.

| Layer | Location reference |
|-------|-------------------|
| DB models | `packages/backfield-db` — `SubstrateLocation*`, `StylebookLocation*` |
| Shared contracts | `backfield_db/entity_contracts.py`, `backfield_stylebook/entity_types.py` |
| Worker persist | `worker/substrate/entities/location/` + `orchestration.py` |
| Stylebook logic | `backfield_stylebook/entities/location/persist.py` |
| stylebook-api | `stylebook_api/entities/location/` |
| stylebook-ui | Location pages + `entityRegistry.ts` |
| Extract node | `agate_nodes/place_extract/` |
| Enrichment (location only) | `agate_nodes/geocode_agent/` |
| agate-api review | `api/processed_item/entities/location/` |
| agate-ui review | `apps/agate-ui/src/lib/review/entities/location/` |

---

## Add a pipeline node only (no new EntityType)

When adding a node that does **not** introduce a new Stylebook `EntityType`:

1. Create `packages/backfield-agate/src/agate_nodes/<snake_case>/` with `metadata.json`, `node.py`, `ui/`
2. Run `npm run sync-nodes` in `apps/agate-ui`
3. If the node writes substrate, match consolidated keys registered in `entity_types.py` and extend orchestration deliberately
4. `db_output` remains the standard persist node

---

## Validation

After implementation issues merge:

```bash
make lint
make test
```

After cross-service runtime changes:

```bash
make smoke
```

See `docs/TESTING.md` for layer-focused tests.
